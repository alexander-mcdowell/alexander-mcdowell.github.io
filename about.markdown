As you can see from the title of this blog, my name is Alexander McDowell. I am currently an undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine. I am studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, which will likely be the primary topic of my blog posts. I will (hopefully!) find time to talk about my other interests in music theory, video games, and perhaps even the intersection of all three topics!

I plan on using this blog to talk about various mathematical things that I find novel or interesting, showcasing any major projects or publications I am working on / created, or just anything that I find particularly noteworthy to share.

I am still in the process of setting everything on the webpage up, so it will look a little barren or rough around the edges for a while.
