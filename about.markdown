My name is Alexander McDowell. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelors in Pure Mathematics and a Minor in Information and Computer Science. I will be using this blog to showcase any projects or publications related to my interests in Mathematics and Computer Science as well as anything that I think is noteworthy enough to share. I may also discuss my other interests in music theory and video games.

I am a huge fan of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) and highly encourage you check it out! It is a website that posts challenging mathematics problems with an emphasis on number theory, combinatorics, and computational mathematics.

I also post arrangements and transcriptions on MuseScore. Check me out [here](https://musescore.com/user/1214651)! I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@luthanicus) that I will sometimes (extremely rarely) post to.
