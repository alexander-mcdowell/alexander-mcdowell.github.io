My name is Alexander McDowell and I am currently an undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine. I am studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, which will likely be the primary topic of my blog posts. I will (hopefully!) find time to talk about my other interests in music theory, video games, and perhaps even the intersection of all three topics!

I plan on using this blog to talk about various mathematical things that I find novel or interesting, showcasing any major projects or publications I am working on / created, or just anything that I find particularly noteworthy to share.

I post arrangements and transcriptions on MuseScore. Check me out [here](https://musescore.com/user/1214651).
