This post serves as a link to my submission to the [Summer of Math Exposition contest](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1) (SoME) hosted by the YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). Though it is a little rough around the edges, I think it still discusses some interesting and relatively obscure mathematics.
