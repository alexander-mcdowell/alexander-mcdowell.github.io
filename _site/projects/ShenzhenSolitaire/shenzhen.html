    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <div id="how-to-play">
        <p>
            To win Shenzhen Solitaire, you must:
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Stack all of the numbered cards in ascending order into three piles in the top right corner.</li>
                <li>Move the flower card to its pile in the top right.</li>
                <li>Consolidate all dragons to the free spaces in the top left.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Note that "ascending" / "descending" order must include all numbers 1-9.
        </p>

        <p>
            Numbered cards must be stacked in descending order and alternating color.<br>
            A numbered card must be moved to a free space or a numbered card one more than it with different color.<br>
            Any stack of descending and alternating cards may be moved.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Dragon cards are represented by the symbols <span style="color: #A10F00;">中</span>, <span style="color: #289664;">發</span>, and <span style="color: #0F0F0F;">▯</span> and can only be moved to a free space.<br>
            If all dragon cards are visible and there is an available free space in the top left, the corresponding dragon button will light up.<br>
            Pressing the button will consolidate all dragons of that color and "lock" the free space, preventing any more cards from being placed.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            The flower card, represented by the symbol <span style="color: #A10F00;">❀</span>, may only move to the flower space in the top right.
        </p>

        <p>
            An "auto-move" algorithm will automatically move cards that can move to the sorted pile without making the game impossible.
        </p>
